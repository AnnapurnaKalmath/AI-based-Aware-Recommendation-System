# AI-based-Aware-Recommendation-System
An AI-driven, neuroscience-inspired recommendation system designed to combat digital distractions and enhance productivity. By analyzing user behavior and providing personalized interventions, it helps users maintain focus without sacrificing balanced leisure.

## Project Overview

In todayâ€™s hyper-connected world, digital distractions have become a formidable barrier to productivity and personal growth. The constant influx of content fuels a pleasure-guilt cycle, making it difficult for users to stay focused and aligned with their goals. This project tackles this growing challenge by combining cutting-edge AI, behavior analysis, and neuroscience-inspired insights to build a truly aware and adaptive recommendation system. By understanding user behavior and intervening thoughtfully, this system empowers users to reclaim their focus without sacrificing leisure.

Currently, the system is primarily focused on students and video recommendations, with the potential for further modification and expansion.

## Key Features

### 1. Distraction Profile (Backend)

Personalized Behavior Analysis: Identifies a userâ€™s unique distraction tendencies (akin to understanding a personâ€™s "drug of choice" in digital behavior).

Historical Data Utilization: Uses behavioral analysis and historical data to build personalized distraction patterns.

Cold Start Problem Solution: Solves the cold start problem for new users by prompting a questionnaire during their starting phase and then adapts as it gains more data.

### 2. State Identification

Focus or Leisure Detection: Determines the userâ€™s current state (Focus or Leisure) based on their distraction profile, engagement patterns, and activity recognition.

NLP-Powered Intent Recognition: Uses natural language processing (NLP) to identify user intent through searches and prompts.

### 3. Slip Detection & Nudge Mechanism

Respectful Reflection-Based System: This is a reflection-based system, not a strict intervention tool â€” it respects leisure time and only intervenes when necessary.

Diversion Detection: Detects shifts from productive content (like educational or work-related material) to non-productive content (like entertainment).

Priority Tracking: Prioritizes identifying engagement with the userâ€™s "drug of choice" while also tracking other distracting content.

#### 10-Minute Observation Window:

After detecting the first diversion, the system allows a 10-minute window without intervention.

User behavior is monitored during this period, offering a chance for self-correction.

If engagement with a recurring distraction pattern is detected within this window, the system flags it.

### 4. Time Tracking

Focused & Leisure Time Logging: Logs focused and leisure time, providing insights into productivity patterns.

Visual Engagement Stats: Visualizes daily, weekly, and monthly engagement data.

### 5. Daily Reflection

End-of-Day Reflection: Prompts users to reflect on their dayâ€™s productivity and distraction levels.

Profile Refinement: Uses reflection data to refine the distraction profile over time.

### 6. Gamified Dashboard

Streaks & Milestones: Tracks user streaks and achievements, incorporating gamification to motivate consistency.

Progress Visualization: Provides visual feedback on productivity and balanced leisure.

### 7. AI-Based Aware Recommendation System

Hybrid Recommendation Approach: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering with neural networks to create a hybrid recommendation engine.

Behavior-Adaptive Suggestions: Personalizes recommendations based on the user's distraction profile and current state.

### 8. Reinforcement Learning Integration (In Progress)

Adaptive Personalization: Plans to personalize recommendations and nudging strategies using reinforcement learning algorithms.

Continuous Optimization: Continuously improves suggestions based on user feedback and engagement patterns.

## Development Status

This project is currently in the development phase. While the core framework and methodology remain consistent, certain features and mechanisms may evolve as implementation progresses. The recommendation engine is under active development and will soon integrate with the projectâ€™s core features.

## Future Scope

Multi-Platform Expansion: Extend support beyond video recommendations to other content types.

Enhanced User Profiling: Introduce more sophisticated profiling based on neuroscience-driven models.

Advanced Reinforcement Learning: Develop deeper reinforcement learning strategies for better adaptive interventions.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions and feedback! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.

## Acknowledgments

Inspired by principles of AI, machine learning, and neuroscience, this project aims to create an adaptive and aware recommendation system that not only understands user behavior but actively helps combat digital distraction and promote productivity.
